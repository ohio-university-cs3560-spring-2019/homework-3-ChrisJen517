In order to find the standard deviation for a given set of numbers the 
equation \[stddev = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i = 1}^n (x - \bar x)^2 }\]
where n corresponds to the total number of numbers being combined, and 
\(bar x\) corresponds to the average of the numbers. This calculation 
is widely used by researches, scientists, as well as engineers due to 
its ability to calculate the range of a given set of data.
